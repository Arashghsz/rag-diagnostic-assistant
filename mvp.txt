Symptom Diagnostic Assistant (SDA)

The Symptom Diagnostic Assistant (SDA) is a comprehensive service designed to assist healthcare providers with real-time symptom analysis, condition prediction, and follow-up question suggestions. The platform primarily serves doctors and medical practitioners, while also providing value to secondary users such as medical researchers, healthcare administrators, and patients.

Core Features and Functionality:
The platform's foundation rests on three main pillars: Symptom Analysis, Condition Prediction, and Follow-Up Advice. The Symptom Analysis component identifies symptoms from patient descriptions and matches them with potential conditions using a comprehensive dataset. The Condition Prediction component uses historical data to predict the most likely conditions based on the provided symptoms. The Follow-Up Advice component suggests follow-up questions to refine the diagnosis and ensure comprehensive patient care.

Agent System Architecture:
The platform utilizes three specialized AI agents working in concert:

The DiagnosticAgent focuses on identifying symptoms from patient descriptions and asking dynamic follow-up questions to refine the diagnosis. This agent provides a list of potential conditions based on the analyzed symptoms. Tasks include:
1. Analyze the provided symptoms and list potential conditions from the dataset.
2. Ask dynamic follow-up questions to refine the diagnosis based on the patient's responses.
3. Communicate with the RecommendationAgent and ExplanationAgent to refine the analysis based on additional data.
4. On the first iteration, ask follow-up questions based on the user's initial input and profile.

The RecommendationAgent focuses on providing recommendations based on the predicted conditions. This agent suggests actions or treatments that can help alleviate the symptoms and improve patient care. Tasks include:
1. Provide recommendations based on the predicted conditions from the dataset.
2. Suggest actions or treatments that can help alleviate the symptoms.
3. Collaborate with the DiagnosticAgent and ExplanationAgent to ensure accurate and helpful recommendations.
4. On the first iteration, collect patient-specific details.

The ExplanationAgent focuses on explaining the diagnosis and recommendations. This agent provides detailed explanations based on the symptom pattern and typical cases, helping patients understand their condition and the suggested actions. Tasks include:
1. Explain the diagnosis based on the symptom pattern and typical cases from the dataset.
2. Provide detailed explanations for the recommended actions or treatments.
3. Work with the DiagnosticAgent and RecommendationAgent to provide comprehensive explanations.
4. On the first iteration, explain the process of solving the user's problem with the help of previous agents.

Agent Interactions and Integration:
The three agents work collaboratively through structured interactions. The Symptom-Condition Integration enables accurate condition predictions based on symptom analysis. The Condition-FollowUp Coordination facilitates comprehensive follow-up advice based on predicted conditions. The FollowUp-Symptom Alignment ensures refined symptom analysis and accurate condition predictions.

Note: There are only Two iterations, and user input is collected only during the first iteration.
