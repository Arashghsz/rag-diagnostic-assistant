  - Recommended treatments  
- **Provides**:
  - Reasoning behind diagnosis  
  - Explanation of treatment choices  
  - Additional context for patient  
- **Marks completion with [EXPLANATION_COMPLETE]**

---

### Knowledge Base Integration

- **Continuous support** throughout the workflow  
- **Provides**:
  - Symptom matching  
  - Question suggestions  
  - Condition correlations  
- **Uses**:
  - Semantic search  
  - Embedding-based retrieval  
  - Cached responses  

---

### Session Management
